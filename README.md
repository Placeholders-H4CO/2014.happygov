<p>HappyGov is a citizen satisfaction platform set out to bring citizens unique access to the service requests and issues that make up the Denver 3-1-1 central repository. We provide an advanced view of issues that are specific to a location or address, enabling access to public agency information and creating transparency within public agencies. Citizens have the freedom to vote on issues, complaints and requests in the system to establish a queue of high priority items that matter the most. For those unfamiliar, the existing 3-1-1 service request interface can be a challenge to find open requests, not to mention password and request id #’s often get lost. HappyGov has created an advanced view of preexisting 3-1-1 data by using Esri's ArcGis API to overlay 3-1-1 service requests with geo-location.</p>

<p>HappyGov is not only a tool for citizens to submit, track and monitor local service requests and complaints, but it’s the central hub for public information that can create efficiencies within the public sector by cutting back on 3-1-1 call volume for information requests. </p>

<p>We plan to focus on growing awareness based on the HappyGov mantra of satisfying the citizen, as well as inbound marketing strategies, such as building social sharing functionality. To keep our users smiling, HappyGov has proposed a feedback loop between citizens and public agencies using the SendGrid API to track issues based on the status of open and closed. HappyGov has plans to develop a more robust user profile interface, focused on we have plans to integrate social credential logins and provide citizens with request tracking and a history of their requests.</p>

<strong>Key Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Happy Gov provides a new lens on preexisting 3-1-1 data by integrating with ArcGis to enable a bigger picture of all service requests submitted to the system. We also provide a heat map view and pindrop view.</li>

<li>We've built a simple and easy-to-digest dashboard to monitor high level volume data of service requests.</li>

<li>We feel it’s critical to provide a deeper level of transparency within the 3-1-1 system, therefore we have developed a system to rank requests that are high priority based on voting. Voting is capped at 1 vote per day by IP address.</li>

<li>An improved admin reporting view has been created for data that drills into the neighborhood and zip code level for improved context into local issues and requests.</li>

<li>The user profile interface allows citizens to track their service requests based on open and closed status.</li>
</ul>

<p>HappyGov.com was brought to life at Hack 4 Colorado 2014 and has continued to develop into a fully-functional and customizable service request ecosystem aiming to create more transparency and trust within the public sector across 20 cities in the US.
